All meetings are open to everyone. Meeting notes are provided for the following events.

- [Hack Night](https://github.com/friendlycode/meeting-notes/tree/master/notes)
- [Leadership](https://github.com/friendlycode/meeting-notes/tree/master/leadership) (suspended: Friendly Code no longer has a leadership team that meets)

Action items from meetings are done through issues and can be [tracked easily via Waffle.](https://waffle.io/friendlycode/meeting-notes)

# How To Participate

Please make sure you read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/friendlycode/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md) before participating. Following our Code of Conduct is a requirement for participation. Beyond the Code of Conduct we welcome the participation of everyone in contributing to improving our brigade and our community. If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Use the #meeting-notes channel within Friendly Code's Slack channel to comment on or make suggestions/changes to agendas.
